    "inner_text_3": "At Segora, we believe data should be fully leveraged without compromising privacy. By leveraging technologies like Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and Differential Privacy, we ensure that data remains encrypted or anonymized throughout its lifecycle.
